# Terraform AWS-Azure mutlicloud setup

<strong>Project aimed at creating simple site-to-site VPC to VNet connection between Azure and AWS utilizing BGP and IPsec for safe data transfer.</strong>
<br><br>
The topology below is a starter topology for further experiments such as shared multicloud storage, pipelines, terraform provisioning. 

This repository will be updated with each change documented. 

<strong>THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE</strong> --> certain practices here differ a lot from real world scenarios and are not necessary good to apply mainly due to cost/complexity/security reasons. 
Take it as my sandbox to learn terraform + terragrunt later on, while experimenting with multicloud setup.
